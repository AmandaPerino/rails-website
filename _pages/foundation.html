        <h3>Our Mission.</h3>
        <p>To improve the documentation, education, marketing, and events of our framework to the benefit of all new and existing Rails developers, and to ensure a prosperous ecosystem that continues to improve for decades to come.

        <h3>Our Work.</h3>
        <p>The foundation will commission freelancers and firms to work on better written documentation, more compelling screencasts, exciting events, and much more. We've only just gotten started, so more detailed plans are still to follow.</p>
        
        <p>We will also be administering <a href="/trademarks">the Rails trademarks</a> through an exclusive licensee from the trademark owner.</p>

        <p>The foundation is a non-profit 501(c)6 foundation incorporated in the US.</p>

        <hr class="divider" />

        <h3>Our Budget.</h3>
        <p>The eight Core foundation members have together generously endowed the foundation with $1,000,000 USD in seed funding to make a real difference on all the aforementioned areas of improvement. </p>
          
        <p>Going forward, these Core members will contribute a combined $400,000/year, with a further $125,000/year from Contributing members, for a total budget of $525,000 dedicated to fulfilling our mission.</p>

        <p>We thus will not have to rely on funding from individual contributors.</p>
